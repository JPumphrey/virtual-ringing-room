<h3>The site</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Ringing Room! This is a site built for change ringers to continue ringing with one another even when socially distanced. It is under development currently, and new features may show up with little warning. Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you have any issues or suggestions.</p>

<h3> The developers </h3>

<p>The Ringing Room is a joint venture by Leland Paul Kusmer and Bryn Marie Reinstadler, both ringers in the Boston, Massachusetts area.</p>

<h3> The audio </h3>

<p>The tower bell audio is provided by <a href="http://www.hibberts.co.uk/">Bill Hibbert</a>. The handbell recordings are of Leland's bells, with editing and extension by JES.</p>


<h3>Reporting performances on Ringing Room</h3>

<p>We encourage reporting significant Ringing Room performances on BellBoard. The Ringing World has published a set of <a href="https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/news-story.php?id=1584">guidelines</a> for how to report distributed performances, including Ringing Room ones.</p>

<p>Additionally, ringers should be aware that Ringing Room performances do not comply with all of performance norms given in the <a href="https://cccbr.github.io/method_ringing_framework/reporting.html">CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing</a>, and as such this should be clearly stated in the BellBoard submission. At minimum, you should report that the performance was rung using key presses (unless you were using <a href="help#handbell_simulators">handbell simulators</a>) and simulated bell sounds.</p>
